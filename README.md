# **SQL Data Exploration Project on Covid-19**

The SQL Data Exploration Project on COVID-19 data is a comprehensive analysis aimed at deriving valuable insights from real-world data sources. In this project, we obtain COVID-19 data from reliable sources like "Our World in Data" and focus on understanding the pandemic's impact. Key aspects of this exploration include:

1. **Data Sources:** We collect COVID-19 data from trusted sources, ensuring accuracy and reliability. The dataset includes information on cases, deaths, vaccinations, and more. Please use these 2 links to get the data from the 2 excels used in the exploration:
1. Covid Deaths: 
2. Covid Vaccinations:

2. **Metrics and Analysis:** Our exploration involves a deep dive into various metrics and results. We calculate and visualize:

   - Likelihood of Dying: We assess the likelihood of dying if one contracts COVID-19 in their country, helping individuals make informed decisions about their health.
   
   - Percentage of Population Affected: We determine the percentage of the population that has contracted COVID-19 in different countries, providing insights into the scale of the pandemic.
   
   - Infection Rates: We identify countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population, shedding light on regions most affected by the virus.
   
   - Death Counts per Population: We uncover countries with the highest death counts per population, offering a perspective on the severity of the pandemic's impact in different regions.

3. **Global Metrics:** Beyond country-level analysis, we also explore global trends. We track and visualize:

   - Total Cases: We provide daily updates on the total number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide, allowing viewers to monitor the global situation.
   
   - Total Deaths: We offer daily insights into the global death toll from COVID-19, helping us understand the pandemic's overall impact.
   
   - Death Percentage: We calculate and visualize the percentage of deaths in relation to total cases each day, providing a critical indicator of the virus's severity.

This SQL Data Exploration Project empowers viewers to make informed decisions, understand global and regional trends, and gain a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact.

# **Data Cleaning in SQL**

The "Data Cleaning in SQL" project is a crucial initiative aimed at preparing data for meaningful analysis. Data cleaning is a fundamental skill in the data analyst community, and this project encompasses various data cleaning operations, including:

1. **Standardizing Date Format:** Ensuring that date data is consistent and follows a standardized format, facilitating easy analysis and interpretation.

2. **Populating Property Address Data:** Filling in missing or incomplete property address information to make the dataset more comprehensive and useful.

3. **Breaking Out Address into Individual Columns:** Dividing address information into separate columns for Address, City, and State, enhancing data organization and accessibility.

4. **Changing Y and N to Yes and No:** Standardizing values in the "Sold as Vacant" field, making the data more understandable and consistent.

5. **Removing Duplicates:** Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data integrity and accuracy.

6. **Deleting Unused Columns:** Removing columns that are no longer relevant or necessary for the analysis, simplifying the dataset.

This project equips data analysts with the essential skills needed to clean and prepare data effectively, setting the foundation for meaningful and accurate data analysis.

# **Testing Tableau Report using SQL**

The "Testing Tableau Report using SQL" project is a valuable exercise in SQL Quality Assurance (QA) testing, aimed at ensuring the accuracy, functionality, and quality of the HR Analytics Dashboard developed in Tableau. Here are the key components and objectives of this project:

## **Objective:** SQL QA Testing for HR Analytics Dashboard

## **Project Steps and Activities:**

1. **Functional Validation:** This phase involves testing each feature of the HR Analytics Dashboard to ensure that it functions according to the specified requirements. This includes verifying that all filters and action filters within the report operate correctly as per the project's requirements.

2. **Data Validation:** In this step, the accuracy and quality of the data within the HR Analytics Dashboard are assessed. SQL queries are used to extract data from the underlying database, and the values obtained are compared with the data displayed in the Tableau report. Data validation ensures that the data presented in the dashboard is consistent and accurate.

3. **Test Document Creation:** A comprehensive test document is created, which serves as a record of the testing process. This document includes:

   - Screenshots: Screenshots of the HR Analytics Dashboard are captured at various testing stages to visually record the results.
   
   - SQL Queries: The SQL queries used for data validation and testing are documented, providing transparency into the testing process.
   
   - Test Results: The test document records the outcomes of functional and data validation tests, highlighting any discrepancies or issues encountered during testing.
   
   - Observations and Feedback: Any observations, feedback, or notes related to the dashboard's performance and accuracy are documented.

## **Benefits and Outcomes:**

- Ensures Data Accuracy: By comparing data from SQL queries with the data displayed in the Tableau report, data accuracy and consistency are verified.

- Functional Testing: Functional testing ensures that all features and filters within the HR Analytics Dashboard operate as intended, meeting project requirements.

- Documentation: The test document serves as a valuable reference for project stakeholders and future QA efforts, providing a clear record of testing procedures and outcomes.

This project is essential in ensuring that the HR Analytics Dashboard is reliable, accurate, and meets the specified requirements, enhancing its utility for data analysis and decision-making.
